            Stephen Muiru<br>

            Aspiring Computer Scientist<br>
            About Me<br>

            Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Stephen Muiru, a passionate and ambitious<br>
            undergraduate student studying Computer Science. I have a deep fascination with the<br>
            world of technology and its transformative power. With a penchant for problem-solving<br>
            and a love for coding, I am on a mission to carve out a meaningful career in the tech industry.<br>
            Background<br>

            Currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, I am dedicated to honing<br>
            my technical skills and expanding my knowledge base in this ever-evolving field.<br>
            My academic journey has exposed me to various programming languages, algorithms,<br>
            and software development practices, fostering a strong foundation for my future endeavors.<br>
            Expertise<br>

            Equipped with a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and data structures,<br>
            I am proficient in languages such as Python, Java, and C++. Through my coursework and<br>
            personal projects, I am continuously refining my skills in software development, eager<br>
            to take on new challenges and innovate in the digital realm.<br>
            Mission<br>

            My goal is to contribute to the tech landscape by creating innovative solutions that simplify<br>
            complexities and improve the way we interact with technology. I aim to be part of a collaborative<br>
            team that is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of computer science.<br>
            Interests<br>

            When I'm not immersed in lines of code, I enjoy exploring the latest advancements in artificial<br>
            intelligence and machine learning. I also find solace in exploring the outdoors, playing the guitar,<br>
            and indulging in science fiction novels.<br>
